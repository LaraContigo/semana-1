|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|                ls               |List the directories and files on the actual directory|
|                cd               |Go to the main directory, or go to an especific directory|

###I still have not created my alias, I want to create them when I feel more confortable using them; I don't to confuse myself with alias for now. However, these are some alias I think I will use in the future:

|              Alias              |           Command           |              Use            |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|                cl               |            clear            |  Clear/Clean the terminal   |
|               gts               |          git status         |Check the current status of your files, directories and its changes on the terminal|
